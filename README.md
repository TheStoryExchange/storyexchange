# The Story Exchange

A simple map embed.  Map is built in **MapBox Studio** using **MapBox Streets** OpenStreetMap data.  All editing is handled with the ever-useful **geojson.io**.  Pretty light weight all around.

### Set Up

1. create a github account, tell me your username, and I will grant you editing rights to the repo
2. go to [geojson.io](geojson.io), click open > GitHub > James Conkling > storyexchange > gh-pages > stops.geojson
3. click *edit layers* to add, delete, and move points
4. click *table* to edit attributes.  Currently, attributes consist of: title, description, status and photo.  These can expand if there's more info you want in each point.

Tell me what you think.  Cartography, popups, and basic functionality can all change/evolve.
